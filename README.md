# Simple Habit Tracker

This is a simple console application built in C# to track your daily water intake habits. 
I built this application to practise my C# skills.

I was able to integrate C# with Sqlite with the help of [The C# Academy](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/)

- **View Records:** See all the records of your daily water intake.
- **Edit Records:** Modify existing records.
- **Insert Records:** Add new records of your water intake.
